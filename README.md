## Andriod: Mongo DB CRUD

A modern Android [application](app/src/main/java/com/sparrow/mongodb_interaction) built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that fetches and displays a product catalog from a MongoDB Atlas backend using Ktor for networking. The app features a responsive two-column grid of products with square images, a Material 3 Scaffold with a top app bar and bottom navigation bar, and a loading state indicator.
